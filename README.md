# verifier_workshop_project
This is a repository for a workshop project in formal verification.

Overview
This project aims to develop a formal verification tool that can verify Hoare logic triples for a simple programming language, referred to as the "while" language. This language supports basic commands such as skip, assignment, if/else, while, and sequence. Our tool translates these Hoare triples into first-order logic formulas, which are then solved using the Z3 SMT solver. This approach ensures that given a precondition and a postcondition, the tool can automatically verify whether a program (composed of the supported commands) satisfies the postcondition when started in a state that satisfies the precondition.


Language and Command Classes:

Implemented classes to represent each command in the "while" language.
Skip: Represents a no-operation.
Assign: Represents variable assignment.
IfElse: Represents conditional branching.
While: Represents a while loop.
Seq: Represents a sequence of commands.
Hoare Triple Verification:

Developed a method to translate Hoare triples into first-order logic formulas.
Implemented a verify function for each command class to handle the translation.

Integration with Z3:
Integrated the Z3 SMT solver to solve the first-order logic formulas generated by the verifier.
Ensured that the solver checks the validity of the formulas and reports whether the Hoare triple holds.
